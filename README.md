# MoHA - Pylon based Discord Study Bot
_Typescript code for pylon (MoHA) discord bot_

MoHA is a Discord bot that tracks members' study and work time while offering members the ability to view their statistics.
You need to invite https://pylon.bot/ bot and install this code on the bot's Studio->Guild->Guild Script.

### ❓ Why ?
The server that we students community were using is primarily for `UPSC CSE` ([here](https://discord.gg/5FMaKbG2qj)) students and related discussions as the name suggests. The libraries are closed due to the ongoing pandemic or maybe you live in a city with no CSE aspirants around to study with or you concentrate better in the presence of other or maybe you want to be more strict and disciplined with your schedule and time table, Live Study/Accountability mechanisms is for all of the above.

In the past couple of years, its been also noticed that on Discord – instead of being a platform designed only for gamers, many students joined it as well, forming communities dedicated to studying and working together.

As soon as we Installed the bot, many of new students made their first step and started using our virtual study rooms/Libary halls as well! Over the months we got many suggestions so we kept updating and adding more and more features to the bot!

I decided to invest further and make the bot public and open-source, so more study servers will be able to enjoy it as well, this way we can connect all study servers, create a network of students and maybe even develop the bot together.
